# Qeet ID — Roadmap

The full picture of **what's available today** and **what's planned next** — plus the internal
package structure that lands with future work. The [README](./README.md) links here.

**Legend:** ✅ shipped · 🟠 planned (high) · 🟡 planned (medium) · 🟢 planned (later) · ⏳ external ops (not code)
**Status:** pre-1.0, feature-complete for the **July 2026 GA** — every ✅ below has working Go code (no stubs).
The golden status inventory is the internal `QEET-ID-STATUS.md` (in the qeet-files PRD hub); the competitive
backlog is distilled by the [`product-manager`](./.claude/agents/product-manager.md) agent.

## 🔭 Planned — not yet available

### Product roadmap
| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CIBA grant (Client-Initiated Backchannel Auth) | 🟠 | Push/email async consent for elevated tokens |
| Prebuilt `<SignIn/>` / `<OrgSwitcher/>` SDK components | 🟡 | `<UserButton/>` already ships in `@qeetid/react` |
| i18n locale catalogs | 🟡 | Scaffold + login done; non-English catalogs + remaining screens pending |
| WCAG 2.2 AA — remaining legacy screens | 🟡 | New screens + lint gate done; expanding to ~70 older admin screens |
| Adaptive / risk-based MFA | 🟡 | Threat-scoring exists; adaptive rule engine pending |

### 🤖 AI-agent identity & governance
*Surfaced by the `product-manager` agent from live competitive research (Auth0 / Okta / WorkOS / Descope / Microsoft Entra).*

| Feature | Priority | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| **Token Vault** | 🟠 | Per-tenant encrypted store for third-party OAuth refresh tokens, so agents call Slack/GitHub/Google on a user's behalf without handling tokens |
| **MCP AS compliance** | 🟠 | RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata + RFC 8707 Resource Indicators (mandated by the MCP 2026-07 spec) |
| **Agent lifecycle + kill switch** | 🟠 | `active`/`suspended`/`decommissioned` state machine with instant authz denial + bulk kill-switch API |
| **Agent-as-Principal** | 🟡 | First-class non-human OIDC principal (`sub_type=agent`, separate `sub` namespace, discovery metadata) |
| **Shadow-AI discovery** | 🟡 | Flag OAuth clients holding live grants but not registered as managed principals |
| **Agent sponsor model** | 🟡 | Every agent tied to a named human owner; auto-transfer on offboarding (no orphaned agents) |
| **AuthZEN PDP/PEP** | 🟡 | OpenID AuthZEN-standard `/evaluation` endpoint + COAZ MCP-tool profile over the existing authz engine |
| **SSF / CAEP events** | 🟡 | Real-time `session-revoked` / `token-claims-change` signals pushed to downstream gateways |
| **Device-bound agent credentials** | 🟢 | TPM/enclave-attested keys + RFC 8705 mTLS — non-exportable, non-replayable M2M creds |

### 🧰 Developer experience
| Feature | Priority | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| `qeetid` management CLI | 🟡 | Single Go binary over the Management API: `migrate`, `keys rotate`, `agents suspend`, `audit export` — `--json` for CI/agents |
| FGA Permissions Index | 🟡 | Pre-computed ReBAC flattening for sub-ms authz in RAG/AI workloads |
| Rust SDK | 🟢 | Async crate scoped to machine identity (client credentials, JWKS, token exchange) |
| SCIM agent extension | 🟢 | `Agent`/`AgenticApplication` resource types (watch `draft-abbey-scim-agent-extension`) |

### ⏳ External ops hardening (not code)
- AWS **KMS BYOK** (`KeyProvider` interface ready — needs a real key) · **OpenID conformance** run against a deployed instance
- Email **deliverability** (SPF/DKIM/DMARC + bounce handling) · **RDS PITR** / backups · external **penetration test**
- Billing **go-live** (Stripe/Razorpay env keys) · managed-cloud infrastructure (multi-region, autoscaling)

## 🧱 Internal structure — planned packages & directories

Placeholder directories were removed so the tree only contains real code; the intent is recorded here.
**Create the directory the day code lands in it.**

### Platform (infrastructure)
| Planned package | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `platform/api/grpc` | gRPC server setup, interceptors | Pairs with `api/protobuf/`. REST-first today. |
